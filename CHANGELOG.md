# ChessKit 0.2.0
Released Wednesday, May 31, 2023.

#### Added
* `MoveTree` and `MoveTree.Index` objects to track move turns and variations.
    * `Game.moves` is now a `MoveTree` object instead of `[Int: MovePair]`
    * `MoveTree.Index` includes piece color and variation so it can be used to directly identify any single move within a game
    * Use the properties and functions of `MoveTree` to retrieve moves within the tree as needed

* `make(move:index:)` and `make(moves:index:)` with ability to make moves on `Game` with SAN strings for convenience
    * For example: `game.make(moves: ["e4", "e5"])`
    
* `PGNParser.convert(game:)` now returns the PGN string for a given game, including variations.
    * Note: `PGNParser.parse(pgn:)` still does not work with variations, this is coming in a future update.
    
* `Game.positions` is now public
    * Contains a dictionary of all positions in the game by `MoveTree.Index`, including variations

#### Removed
* `Game.annotateMove`
    * Modify `Move.assessment` and `Move.comment` directly instead
* `MovePair`
    * Use `Move` in conjuction with `MoveTree.Index` to track move indicies
* `color` parameter from `SANParser.parse()`
    * The color is now obtained from the `sideToMove` in the provided `position`
